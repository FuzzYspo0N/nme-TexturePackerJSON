TexturePackerJSON.hx
=====================

An implementation of a haxelib/spritesheet Loader for TexturePacker (and I think flash sprite sheet export).

License : MIT for code

Please don't use this sprite as your own, it is just for demonstration purposes. It is not available for use at all. Thanks!

**Notes :**

- Uses Joshua Granick's Haxelib called spritesheet
- Requires the hxJson2 parsing lib
- Adds the ability to parse a separate JSON for the behaviors(animations) to add
- Reads JSON from [TexturePacker](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)

**Example project included**, to run the example :    

- haxelib install hxJson2
- nme test mac/windows/whatever

See the project assets folder for example JSON files.
